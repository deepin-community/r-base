Description: GNU R statistical computation and graphics system
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists 
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, 
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs 
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the 
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying 
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows 
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.  
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is 
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the 
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core 
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a 
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math 
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide 
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data 
 presentations. 
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from 
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages, 
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package is a metapackage which eases the transition from the 
 pre-1.5.0 package setup with its larger r-base package. Once installed, it 
 can be safely removed and apt-get will automatically upgrade its components
 during future upgrades.  Providing this package gives a way to users to 
 then only install r-base-core if they so desire.

 This Debian package is now a metapackage that depends on a set of 
 packages that are recommended by the upstream R core team as part of a 
 complete R distribution, and distributed along with the source of R 
 itself, as well as directly via the CRAN network of mirrors. This set
 comprises the following packages (listed in their upstream names):
  - KernSmooth: Functions for kernel smoothing for Wand & Jones (1995)
  - Matrix: Classes and methods for dense and sparse matrices and 
    operations on them using Lapack and SuiteSparse
  - MASS, class, nnet and spatial: packages from Venables and Ripley, 
    `Modern Applied Statistics with S' (4th edition).
  - boot: Bootstrap R (S-Plus) Functions from the book "Bootstrap Methods 
    and Their Applications" by A.C. Davison and D.V. Hinkley (1997).
  - cluster: Functions for clustering (by Rousseeuw et al.)
  - codetools: Code analysis tools for R
  - foreign: Read data stored by Minitab, S, SAS, SPSS, Stata, ...
  - lattice: Implementation of Trellis (R) graphics
  - mgcv: Multiple smoothing parameter estimation and GAMs by GCV
  - nlme: Linear and nonlinear mixed effects models
  - rpart: Recursive partitioning and regression trees
  - survival: Survival analysis, including penalised likelihood.
